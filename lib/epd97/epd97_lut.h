// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The two short waveform tables, one per COG revision.
//
// The panel's own waveform lives in its OTP and is what EPD_SLOW runs. These
// replace it, written to register 0xB0 after the 0x44/0x45/0xA7 sequence (which
// is what loads the OTP waveform into the very registers being replaced) and
// before the DC/DC soft start.
//
// The two revisions take different table formats at the same register:
//
//   driver 8   180 bytes = 5 tables x  9 groups x 4 bytes, frame counts
//              packed two to a byte as nibbles
//   driver B   400 bytes = 5 tables x 10 groups x 8 bytes, one whole byte
//              per frame count
//
// A level byte is two bits per phase with phase 0 in the top bits:
// 0 = ground, 1 = VDH, 2 = VDL, 3 = VDHR.
//
// Table index is (red bit << 1) | bw bit, so 0 = paper, 1 = ink, 2 = red,
// 3 = unreachable, 4 = VCOM.
